/*
    Every component has 3 main life cycle methods
    These are used to monitor and manipulate 
    They are 
    1. Mounting
    2. Updating
    3.UnMounting

    Mounting : Mounting means putting an element in DOM
               React has 4 built in methods that gets called while mounting a component
               1.constructor() - called by react everytime you make a component
               2.getDerivedStateFromProps() - called right before the element in DOM
               3.render() - It is the method actually outputs the HTML to DOM
               componentDidMount() - called after the component is rendered
